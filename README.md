# INWK6312 Lab Submission


This repository is where you should keep all your lab related submissions. 
**Please note that this is the only repository that will be created and given to you**


The current repository snapshot will be taken at every Lab submission deadline, and you will be graded based only on that snapshot!

At the end of this course, (*After the last lab*)
This repository should have 5 different branches named: `lab1`, `lab2`, `lab3`, `lab4`, and `lab5`
<hr>

**Each branch should have only the folder that answers the corresponding lab.**
##### For Example:
* `lab1` branch should have only `lab1` folder with all its submission files inside this folder. 
* `lab2` branch should contain only `lab2` folder and all its submissions files inside this folder and so on ....
<hr>

**The main branch should always contain all the contents from all the branches** 
##### For Example:
* **At the end of working on lab3**,  the `main` branch will contain 3 different folders `lab1`, `lab2` and `lab3` and all  its submissions files inside this respective folders. **You should also have only 3 branches**.

* **At the end of the course**,  the main branch will contain 5 different folders `lab1`, `lab2`... `lab5` and all  its submissions files inside this respective folders. **You should also have 5 branches**.
<hr>

### Your  workflow should be as follows:
* When you want to work on a lab, you create a new branch, with the name of that lab, e.g lab2
* Inside this branch, you create a new folder (with the name of that lab) e.g lab2
* Create files inside this folder to reflect all your submission. *You should be creating commits at different intervals based on your discretion*
* When you are done, push the branch to your remote repo. 
* Create a **Pull-Request** to merge your branch with main branch
* Approve the **Pull-Request** and **Merge**. (**Do not delete the branch**)
